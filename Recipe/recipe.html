            <h3 class="name">BIRYANI</h3></center>

                <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services.</p>

            <h3 class="name">RAITA</h3></center>
            <p>Raita is a side dish in Indian cuisine made of dahi (yogurt, often referred to as curd) together with raw or cooked vegetables, more seldom fruit, or in the case of boondi raita, with fried droplets of batter made from besan (chickpea flour, generally labeled as gram flour).</p>
                <p>The closest approximation in western cuisine is a side dish or dip, or a cooked salad. It is often referred to as a condiment, but unlike traditional western condiments like salt, pepper, mustard and horseradish that make dishes more spicy, a dish of dahi or raita has a cooling effect to contrast with spicy curries and kebabs that are the main fare of some Asian cuisines. In Indian cuisine, some type of flatbread may be eaten together with raita, chutneys and pickles.</p>

                Most of the diversity within A. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important Allium crop. 
                Plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets.</p>
                <p> The majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. The range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod (length of day that triggers bulbing), storage life, flavour, and skin colour.
